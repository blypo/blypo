# Installation

### Clone from Github
You can also clone blypo from github directly, but be aware that this also requires a working composer installation. Run the following commands, then install through the extension manager

```bash
cd typo3conf/ext
mkdir blypo
cd blypo
git clone https://github.com/blypo/blypo .
composer install
```

### TER
Blypo will not be published on the TER, as Blypo relies heavily on composer features.
